  (#30), next steps (#63)

# growthcleanr 1.2.6 - 2021-06-10

## Changed

- Corrected four duplicated age-rows in NHANES reference medians (#40)
- Added missing non-newborn constraint in 14h.ii (thanks Lusha Cao)
- Removed `Hmisc` dependency (#36)
- Replaced `clean_value` result column name in docs with `gcr_result` for
  clarity (#35)

# growthcleanr 1.2.5 - 2021-02-26

## Added

- Added `inst/extdata/nhanes-reference-medians.csv`, reference medians for
  recentering derived from NHANES (described in README)

## Changed

- Updated behavior of `sd.recenter` option to include new NHANES reference
  medians and explicit specification with "NHANES" or "derive"
  (https://github.com/mitre/growthcleanr/issues/9)
- Switched `README.md` to be generated from `README.Rmd` w/knitr (thanks
  @mcanouil) (#17)
- Switched to use `file.path()` more consistently in `R/growth.R`

# growthcleanr 1.2.4 - 2021-01-14

## Changed

- Minor update to WHO HT velocity 3SD files to correct a small number of errors
  (#24). Affected files were:

  - `inst/extdata/who_ht_maxvel_3sd.csv`
  - `inst/extdata/who_ht_vel_3sd.csv`

  Although these changes were very minor, it is possible that results on data
  cleaned after this change may vary from previous results. The prior version of
  these files may be obtained by visiting the tagged release version 1.2.3 at
  https://github.com/carriedaymont/growthcleanr/releases/tag/1.2.3.

  The released version of `growthcleanr` available at that link contains the
  older version of both files; that older version may be used to verify
  reproducibility.

  Alternatively, a more recent version of `growthcleanr` may be used with only
  the affected files replaced with their older versions available at the 1.2.3
  tag link above. This must be done manually.

# growthcleanr 1.2.3 - 2021-01-07

## Added

- New exclusion handling option on experimental carry forward adjustment

## Changed

- Improved experimental carry forward adjustment handling of strings of
  CF values, output handling, and documentation; renamed "Missing" values
- Updated DESCRIPTION, imports, documentation to address testing issue (#12)
- Switched to R-native argparser library to support script options
- Switched to GitHub Actions for continuous integration / testing (thanks
  @mcanouil)
- Improved Dockerfile to standardize user/path, simplify install (thanks
  @mcanouil)

  `ext_bmiz()`
- New function `longwide()` for transforming `cleangrowth()` output for use with
  `ext_bmiz()`

  match `cleangrowth()` or `ext_bmiz()` requirements
- New `exec/gcdriver.R` command-line script for CLI execution of `cleangrowth()`
- New `Dockerfile` (and `.dockerignore`) enabling containerized use of
  `growthcleanr`

  and driver script `exec/testadjustcf.R` (see README-adjustcarryforward.md for
  details)

## Changed

- Reorganized code from `R/growth.R` into separate files for clarity and easier
  maintenance (all utility functions not directly used by `cleangrowth()` are
  now in `R/utils.R`)
